// The rest of this file represents our "data model," the set of classes that we're
// using to represent the data manipulated by our app and presented to the user.

// WeatherData is the top-level object that holds all our data.
//
// It is like a single database that will provide methods and properties for accessing
// all the app's data in one place.
class WeatherData {
    
    // We don't have data structures yet at this point in the course, so we're going to 
    // hold the information about these three locations as separate properties. It's a 
    // little clumsy, but it will work for this little app.

    // the data from a remote server.

    // This enables the "Singleton" pattern. It means that whenever we use 
    // WeatherData.sharedInstance(), we'll always get the same instance of WeatherData.
    // We only need once instance, because we only have one set of app data.
    
    // The "static" keyword means we can dot-access onto the class itself, WeatherData,
    // instead of an instance of the class. This means that properties using "static"
    // only occur once. Instances can't have a different value for these properties.
    static var singleton : WeatherData?
    
    // This method returns an instance of WeatherData that is available everywhere in the
    // app. As opposed to instantiating WeatherData (using the () syntax), this method
    // always returns the *same* instance each time it's called. We want this because
    // we only want one source of data for the app.

        // self.singleton is Optional, so we have to unwrap it.

        // Otherwise, if it's nil, then instantiate the singleton instance, store it,
        // and return it. This initialization only happens once if we consistently use
        // WeatherData.sharedInstance()
        self.singleton = WeatherData()

        // type of sharedInstance above).
