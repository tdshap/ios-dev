# GA MOB 4 - Lesson Plan - 01 - Getting Started

## Objectives


The goals of this lesson are primarily to establish the expectations for the course and to give students a taste of what iPhone development is like. In service of this, students will leave class with a working iPhone app (in the iOS Simulator) of a simple photo gallery.


Students will be able to:

* explain the goals and purpose of the course,
* describe Xcode and Interface Builder,
* explain the four filetypes that comprise most Swift-powered iPhone apps,
* perform the workflow between Xcode and the iOS Simulator,
* add Views to an iPhone app interface with Interface Builder,
* add media (images) to an iPhone app and use them in an interface,
* outline the basic components of an iPhone app,
* label the Xcode IDE window, and
* create a working iOS app.

## Developer Workflow


*60min*


*Goal: Design and Run an iPhone app*


### Outline

* Xcode interface overview
* Start new Xcode project
* Brief orientation around the UI
    * Navigator
    * Inspector
    * Library
    * Debugging area
* Different file types
    * .swift
    * .storyboard
    * .xib
    * .plist
* Xcode tools
    * Interface Builder is a tool inside the Xcode IDE for xib and storyboard files.
    * A code editor is available for Swift files.
    * A plist editor is a special UI for .plist files.
* Practice: Build a Gallery App for Dogs
    * Disable "Auto Layout" for now
    * Place a UIScrollView.
    * Place a label describing the photos (e.g. "Shibas").
    * Run the app (CMD + r).
    * Set the scroll size for the scroll panel (note that this is done manually now, but with code later).
    * Run again and note how the scrolling works.
    * Download photos of Shibas from Google Images.
    * Import a photo.
    * Use a UIImageView to hold the photo in the main View.
    * Run the app â†’ Congratulations.
    * Place more images in a linear, grid, or brick pattern.

### Check for Understanding - CFU

* What are the file types in a typical, Swift-powered iPhone app?
* What tools does Xcode provide for each file type?
* Name three UI components available in Interface Builder.
* Where would I go to find those components?
* How would I add one to an interface?
* Where would I go in Interface Builder to change its color?

## Review and Q+A (10min)


## On Your Own (for next session)

* Read next slide deck on Mobile Interface Design.
* Finish the Pre-work, up to Lesson 4 in *Learning Swift from Scratch.*
* Post something to our Slack channel about an innovative app, helpful article about app development, etc.
* Finish the Dog Gallery app we started in class by adding five more photos.
    * Gain familiarity with navigating around Xcode.
    * Become accustomed to placing Views in Interface Builder.
    * Practice adjusting parameters for various Views with the Inspector.
    * Deploy the Springs-and-Struts layout model.
