* Create, modify, and iterate over dictionaries.
* Identify and use dictionary methods and properties.
* Create and deploy tuples.
* Use tuples as return values.
* Closures through maps and filters.


## Prerequisites

## Topics

* Arrays
    * Declaring the type
    * Explicit declaration

    * map and filter
* Dictionaries
    * Declaring the type
    * Explicit declarations
    * Getting and setting values by key
    * Methods and properties
* Tuples
    * Convenient way to bundle values together
    * The type of the tuple is the ordered collection of types it contains. Must be consistent.
